Full-Featured Blog & CMS

- Concept: A complete blog website, not just an API.

- Monolith Features:
  - User Auth: Use Django's built-in system for user registration, login, and password reset.
  - Views/Templates: Create HTML templates for the home page (list of posts), the post detail page, and a page for users to write new posts.
  - Database (ORM): Define models for Post, Comment, and Category.
  - Admin Panel: Use the built-in Django Admin so you (the admin) can edit, delete, and approve posts or comments without writing any new code.
